STAR WARS Episode IV A NEW HOPE From the JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS by George Lucas Revised Fourth Draft January 15 1976 LUCASFILM LTD A long time ago in a galaxy far far away A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity It is a period of civil war Rebel spaceships striking from a hidden base have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire During the battle Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empires ultimate weapon the Death Star an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet Pursued by the Empires sinister agents Princess Leia races home aboard her starship custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse her two moons glowing against the darkness A tiny silver spacecraft a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship races through space It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER MAIN PASSAGEWAY An explosion rocks the ship as two robots ArtooDetoo R2 D2 and SeeThreepio C3PO struggle to make their way through the shaking bouncing passageway Both robots are old and battered Artoo is a short clawarmed tripod His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye Threepio on the other hand is a tall slender robot of human proportions He has a gleaming bronzelike metallic surface of an Art Deco design Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way THREEPIO Did you hear that Theyve shut down the main reactor Well be destroyed for sure This is madness Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway They aim their weapons toward the door THREEPIO Were doomed The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand THREEPIO Therell be no escape for the Princess this time Artoo continues making beeping sounds Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship THREEPIO Whats that EXT SPACECRAFT IN SPACE The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smokefilled corridor In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke holding shattered arms and faces An explosion hits near the robots THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a halfsized thermocapsulary dehousing assister Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots EXT TATOOINE DESERT WASTELAND DAY A deathwhite wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure Luke Skywalker a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prizewinning smile A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves He is aided by a beatup treadrobot with six claw arms The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Lukes eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens then dashed toward his dented crudely repaired Landspeeder an autolike transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magneticfield He motions for the tiny robot to follow him LUKE Hurry up Come with me What are you waiting for Get in gear The robot scoots around in a tight circle stops short and smoke begins to pour out of every joint Luke throws his arms up in disgust Exasperated the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER MAIN HALLWAY The awesome sevenfoottall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway This is Darth Vader right hand of the Emperor His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER A womans hand puts a card into an opening in Artoos dome Artoo makes beeping sounds INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER Threepio stands in a hallway somewhat bewildered Artoo is nowhere in sight The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance THREEPIO Artoo ArtooDetoo where are you A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepios attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke filled alcove A beautiful young girl about sixteen years old stands in front of Artoo Surreal and out of place dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke she finishes adjusting something on Artoos computer face then watches as the little robot joins his companion THREEPIO At last Where have you been Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance THREEPIO Theyre heading in this direction What are we going to do Well be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway Threepio chases after him THREEPIO Wait a minute where are you going Artoo responds with electronic beeps INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER CORRIDOR The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer who struggles in vain VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat VADER What have you done with those plans REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions Aaah This is a consular ship Were on a diplomatic mission VADER If this is a consular ship were is the Ambassador The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officers throat creating a gruesome snapping and choking until the soldier goes limp Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops VADER Commander tear this ship apart until youve found those plans and bring me the Ambassador I want her alive The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER SUBHALLWAY The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship She is Princess Leia Organa a member of the Alderaan Senate The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder One of the troopers spots her TROOPER There she is Set for stun Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray The troopers inspect her inert body TROOPER Shell be all right Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER SUBHALLWAY Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash The stubby astrorobot works his way into the cramped fourman pod THREEPIO Hey youre not permitted in there Its restricted Youll be deactivated for sure Artoo beeps something to him THREEPIO Dont call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease Now come out before somebody sees you Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform THREEPIO Secret mission What plans What are you talking about Im not getting in there Artoo isnt happy with Threepios stubbornness and he beeps and twangs angrily A new explosion this time very close sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway Flames lick at Threepio and after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod THREEPIO Im going to regret this INT IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER On the main viewscreen the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft CHIEF PILOT There goes another one CAPTAIN Hold your fire There are no life forms It must have been short circuited INT LIFEPOD Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy THREEPIO Thats funny the damage doesnt look as bad from out here Artoo beeps an assuring response THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe EXT TATOOINE ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT POWER STATION DAY Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past WOMAN Ive told you kids to slow down INT POWER STATION DAY Luke bursts into the power station waking The Fixer a rugged mechanic and Camie a sexy disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap They grumbled as he races through the office yelling wildly FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here CAMIE It was just wormie on another rampage Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy two tough boys about the same age as Luke are playing a computer poollike game with Biggs a burly handsome boy a few years older than the rest His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loosefitting tunics of the farm boys A robot repairs some equipment in the background LUKE Shape it up you guys Biggs Lukes surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion They give each other a great bear hug LUKE I didnt know you were back When did you get in BIGGS Just now I wanted to surprise you hot shot I thought youd be here certainly didnt expect you to be out working he laughs LUKE The Academy didnt change you muchbut youre back so soon Hey what happened didnt you get your commission Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony BIGGS Of course I got it Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service he salutes I just came to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons Everyone laughs The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke but suddenly he snaps out of it LUKE I almost forgot Theres a battle going on Right here in our system Come and look DEAK Not again Forget it EXT TATOOINE ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT POWER STATION DAY The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens LUKE There they are Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks BIGGS Thats no battle hot shot theyre just sitting there Probably a freightertanker refueling LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process Luke grabs them LUKE Hey easy with those CAMIE Dont worry about it Wormie The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation FIXER I keep telling you the Rebellion is a long way from here I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system Believe me Luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing Luke agrees although its obvious he isnt sure why The group stumbles back into the power station grumbling about Lukes ineptitude INT REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER HALLWAY Princess Leia is led down a lowceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator but she doesnt move LEIA Lord Vader I should have known Only you could be so bold The Imperial Senate will not sit for this when they hear youve attacked a diplomatic VADER Dont play games with me Your Highness You werent on any mercy mission this time You passed directly through a restricted system Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you LEIA I dont know what youre talking about Im a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan VADER Youre a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor Take her away Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship An Imperial Commander turns to Vader COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous If word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her Now she is my only link to find their secret base COMMANDER Shell die before she tells you anything VADER Leave that to me Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander They stop and snap to attention SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship And no transmissions were made An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard Vader turns to the Commander VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod Send a detachment down to retrieve them See to it personally Commander Therell be no one to stop us this time COMMANDER Yes sir EXT SPACE The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine EXT TATOOINE DESERT Jundland or No Mans Land where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea The two helpless astrodroids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand THREEPIO How did I get into this mess I really dont know how We seem to be made to suffer Its our lot in life Artoo answers with beeping sounds THREEPIO Ive got to rest before I fall apart My joints are almost frozen Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds THREEPIO What a desolate place this is Suddenly Artoo whistles makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas Threepio stops and yells at him THREEPIO Where are you going A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot THREEPIO Well Im not going that way Its much too rocky This way is much easier Artoo counters with a long whistle THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there Artoo continues to make beeping sounds THREEPIO Dont get technical with me Artoo continues to make beeping sounds THREEPIO What mission What are you talking about Ive had just about enough of you Go that way Youll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea THREEPIO And dont let me catch you following me begging for help because you wont get it Artoos reply is a rather rude sound He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas THREEPIO No more adventures Im not going that way Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains EXT TATOOINE DUNE SEA Threepio hot and tired struggles up over the ridge of a dune only to find more dunes which seem to go on for endless miles He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp This is all his fault He tricked me into going this way but hell do no better In a huff of anger and frustration Threepio knocks the sand from his joints His plight seems hopeless when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him THREEPIO Wait whats that A transport Im saved The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport THREEPIO Over here Help Please help EXT TATOOINE ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT POWER STATION DAY Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew Fixer and the others can be heard working inside LUKE Very animated so I cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deaks trail I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad Uncle Owen was pretty upset He grounded me for the rest of the season You should have been there it was fantastic BIGGS You ought to take it easy Luke You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous Keep it up and one day whammo youre going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall LUKE Look whos talking Now that youve been around those giant starships youre beginning to sound like my uncle Youve gotten soft in the city BIGGS Ive missed you kid LUKE Well things havent been the same since you left Biggs Its been so quiet Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke BIGGS Luke I didnt come back just to say goodbye I shouldnt tell you this but youre the only one I can trust and if I dont come back I want somebody to know Lukes eyes are wide with Biggs seriousness and loyalty LUKE What are you talking about BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy he whispers when our frigate goes to one of the central systems were going to jump ship and join the Alliance Luke amazed and stunned is almost speechless LUKE Join the Rebellion Are you kidding How BIGGS Quiet down will ya You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater LUKE Im sorry Im quiet he whispers Listen how quiet I am You can barely hear me Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact LUKE Youre crazy You could wander around forever trying to find them BIGGS I know its a long shot but if I dont find them Ill do what I can on my own Its what we always talked about Luke Im not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side the side I believe in LUKE And Im stuck here BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term Youll get your chance to get off this rock LUKE Not likely I had to cancel my application There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left theyve even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster LUKE I know but hes got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off He needs me for just one more season I cant leave him now BIGGS I feel for you Luke youre going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important What good is all your uncles work if its taken over by the Empire You know theyre starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems it wont be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the Empire LUKE It couldnt happen here You said it yourself The Empire wont bother with this rock BIGGS Things always change LUKE I wish I was going Are you going to be around long BIGGS No Im leaving in the morning LUKE Then I guess I wont see you BIGGS Maybe someday Ill keep a lookout LUKE Well Ill be at the Academy next season after that who knows I wont be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet thats for sure Take care of yourself youll always be the best friend Ive got BIGGS So long Luke Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON SUNSET The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes He hears a distant hard metallic sound and stops for a moment Convinced he is alone he continues on his way In the distance a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly out of nowhere a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back His bright computer lights flicker off then on then off again Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas no taller than Artoo They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON SANDCRAWLER SUNSET The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank like vehicle the size of a fourstory house They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport INT SANDCRAWLER HOLD AREA It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astrorobots He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber INT SANDCRAWLER PRISON AREA Artoo enters a wide room with a fourfoot ceiling In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes Some are engaged in electronic conversation while others simply mill about A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom THREEPIO ArtooDetoo Its you Its you A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON SANDCRAWLER SUNSET The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge EXT TATOOINE DESERT DAY Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine A trooper yells to an officer some distance away FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod The tracks go off in this direction A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper SECOND TROOPER Look sir droids EXT TATOOINE DUNES The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune INT SANDCRAWLER Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber Artoo appears to be shut off THREEPIO Wake up Wake up Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men Threepios fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens filling the chamber with blinding white light a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots THREEPIO Were doomed A Jawa starts moving toward them THREEPIO Do you think theyll melt us down Artoo responds making beeping sounds THREEPIO Dont shoot Dont shoot Will this never end EXT TATOOINE DESERT LARS HOMESTEAD AFTERNOON The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives including Artoo and Threepio in front of the enormous Sandcrawler which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow The shrouded little creatures smell horribly attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be Out of the shadows of a dingy sidebuilding limps Owen Lars a large burly man in his midfifties His reddish eyes are sunken in a dustcovered face As the farmer carefully inspects each robot he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew Luke Skywalker One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer unintelligible language A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard BERU Luke tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce LUKE It looks like we dont have much of a choice but Ill remind him Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid THREEPIO quickly Sir not in an environment such as this thats why Ive also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators THREEPIO Vaporators Sir My first job was programming binary load lifter very similar to your vaporators You could say OWEN Do you speak Bocce THREEPIO Of course I can sir Its like a second language for me Im as fluent in Bocce OWEN All right shut up turning to Jawa Ill take this one THREEPIO Shutting up sir OWEN Luke take these two over to the garage will you I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done Now come on get to it LUKE All right come on And the red one come on Well come on Red lets go As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio He is restrained by a slimy Jawa who zaps him with a control box Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astrodroids head plate and it sparks wildly LUKE Uncle Owen OWEN Yeah LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator Look OWEN to the head Jawa Hey whatre you trying to push on us The Jawa goes into a loud spiel Meanwhile Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention He lets out with a low whistle Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder THREEPIO pointing to Artoo Excuse me sir but that R2 unit is in prime condition A real bargain LUKE Uncle Owen OWEN Yeah LUKE What about that one OWEN to Jawa What about that blue one Well take that one With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astrodroid for Artoo LUKE Yeah take it away THREEPIO Uh Im quite sure youll be very pleased with that one sir He really is in firstclass condition Ive worked with him before Here he comes Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry LUKE Okay lets go THREEPIO to Artoo Now dont you forget this Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity INT LARS HOMESTEAD GARAGE AREA LATE AFTERNOON The garage is cluttered and worn but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face THREEPIO Thank the maker This oil bath is going to feel so good Ive got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move Artoo beeps a muffled reply Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small twoman Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage Finally Lukes frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench LUKE It just isnt fair Oh Biggs is right Im never gonna get out of here THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help Luke glances at the battered robot A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face LUKE Well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock THREEPIO I dont think so sir Im only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things Not on this planet anyways As a matter of fact Im not even sure which planet Im on LUKE Well if theres a bright center to the universe youre on the planet that its farthest from THREEPIO I see sir LUKE Uh you can call me Luke THREEPIO I see sir Luke LUKE laughing Just Luke THREEPIO And I am SeeThreepio humancyborg relations and this is my counterpart ArtooDetoo LUKE Hello Artoo beeps in response Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robots head with a chrome pick Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action THREEPIO With all weve been through sometimes Im amazed were in as good condition as we are what with the Rebellion and all LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire THREEPIO Thats how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir LUKE Have you been in many battles THREEPIO Several I think Actually theres not much to tell Im not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories Well not at making them interesting anyways Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoos neck joint He uses a larger pick LUKE Well my little friend youve got something jammed in here real good Were you on a cruiser or The fragment breaks loose with a snap sending Luke tumbling head over heels He sits up and sees a twelveinch three dimensional hologram of Leia Organa the Rebel senator being projected from the face of little Artoo The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage Lukes mouth hangs open in awe LEIA Help me ObiWan Kenobi Youre my only hope LUKE Whats this Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over THREEPIO What is what He asked you a question pointing to Leia What is that Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over LEIA Help me ObiWan Kenobi Youre my only hope Help me ObiWan Kenobi Youre my only hope THREEPIO Oh he says its nothing sir Merely a malfunction Old data Pay it no mind Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl LUKE Who is she Shes beautiful THREEPIO Im afraid Im not quite sure sir LEIA Help me ObiWan Kenobi THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage A person of some importance sir I believe Our captain was attached to LUKE Is there more to this recording Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle THREEPIO Behave yourself Artoo Youre going to get us in trouble Its all right you can trust him Hes our new master Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio THREEPIO He says hes the property of ObiWan Kenobi a resident of these parts And its a private message for him Quite frankly sir I dont know what hes talking about Our last master was Captain Antilles but with what weve been through this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric LUKE ObiWan Kenobi I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi THREEPIO I beg your pardon sir but do you know what hes talking about LUKE Well I dont know anyone named Obi Wan but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea Hes kind of a strange old hermit Lukes gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments LUKE I wonder who she is It sounds like shes in trouble Id better play back the whole thing Artoo beeps something to Threepio THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system He suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording Luke looks longingly at the lovely little princess and hasnt really heard what Threepio has been saying LUKE Hm Oh yeah well I guess youre too small to run away on me if I take this off Okay Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoos side LUKE There you go The princess immediately disappears LUKE Well wait a minute Whered she go Bring her back Play back the entire message Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment THREEPIO What message The one youre carrying inside your rusty innards A womens voice calls out from another room AUNT BERU Luke Luke Come to dinner Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot LUKE All right Ill be right there Aunt Beru THREEPIO Im sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter Luke tosses Artoos restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room LUKE Well see what you can do with him Ill be right back THREEPIO to Artoo Just you reconsider playing that message for him Artoo beeps in response THREEPIO No I dont think he likes you at all Artoo beeps THREEPIO No I dont like you either INT LARS HOMESTEAD DINING AREA Lukes Aunt Beru a warm motherly woman fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well used kitchen She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain LUKE You know I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen OWEN What makes you think that LUKE Well I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him He says he belongs to someone called ObiWan Kenobi Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name but manages to control himself LUKE I thought he might have meant old Ben Do you know what hes talking about Well I wonder if hes related to Ben Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger OWEN That old mans just a crazy old wizard Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed Thatll be the end of it It belongs to us now LUKE But what if this ObiWan comes looking for him OWEN He wont I dont think he exists any more He died about the same time as your father LUKE He knew my father OWEN I told you to forget it Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers LUKE Yes sir I think those new droids are going to work out fine In fact I uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season And if these new droids do work out I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year Owens face becomes a scowl although he tries to suppress it OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest LUKE Sure therere more than enough droids OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most Only one more season This year well make enough on the harvest so Ill be able to hire some more hands And then you can go to the Academy next year Luke continues to toy with his food not looking at his uncle OWEN You must understand I need you here Luke LUKE But its a whole nother year OWEN Look its only one more season Luke pushes his halfeaten plate of food aside and stands LUKE Yeah thats what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left AUNT BERU Where are you going LUKE It looks like Im going nowhere I have to finish cleaning those droids Resigned to his fate Luke paddles out of the room Owen mechanically finishes his dinner AUNT BERU Owen he cant stay here forever Most of his friends have gone It means so much to him OWEN Ill make it up to him next year I promise AUNT BERU Lukes just not a farmer Owen He has too much of his father in him OWEN Thats what Im afraid of EXT TATOOINE LARS HOMESTEAD The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range Luke stands watching them for a few moments then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead INT LARS HOMESTEAD GARAGE Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying He activates the box which creates a low hum and Threepio letting out a short yell pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship LUKE What are you doing hiding there Threepio stumbles forward but Artoo is still nowhere in sight THREEPIO It wasnt my fault sir Please dont deactivate me I told him not to go but hes faulty malfunctioning kept babbling on about his mission LUKE Oh no Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio EXT TATOOINE LARS HOMESTEAD Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro robot Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand Even I cant understand their logic at times LUKE How could I be so stupid Hes nowhere in sight Blast it THREEPIO Pardon me sir but couldnt we go after him LUKE Its too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around Well have to wait until morning Owen yells up from the homestead plaza OWEN Luke Im shutting the power down for the night LUKE All right Ill be there in a few minutes Boy am I gonna get it He takes one final look across the dim horizon LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble THREEPIO Oh he excels at that sir INT LARS HOMESTEAD PLAZA Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen his voice echoing throughout the homestead OWEN Luke Luke Luke Where could he be loafing now INT LARS HOMESTEAD KITCHEN The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast Owen enters in a huff OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early OWEN Uh Did he take those two new droids with him AUNT BERU I think so OWEN Well hed better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or therell be hell to pay EXT TATOOINE DESERT WASTELAND LUKES SPEEDER DAY The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland INTEXT LUKES SPEEDER DESERT WASTELAND TRAVELING DAY Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment LUKE yelling Hows that Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the windwhipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but I dont see how that R2 unit could have come this far We must have missed him Uncle Owen isnt going to take this very well THREEPIO Sir would it help if you told him it was my fault LUKE brightening Sure He needs you Hed probably only deactivate you for a day or so THREEPIO Deactivate Well on the other hand if you hadnt removed his restraining bolt LUKE Wait theres something dead ahead on the scanner It looks like our droid hit the accelerator EXT TATOOINE ROCK MESA DUNE SEA COASTLINE DAY From high on a rock mesa the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor Suddenly in the foreground two weatherbeaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired The Sandpeople or Tusken Raiders as theyre sometimes called speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain EXT TATOOINE ROCK MESA CANYON The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock The monstrous bearlike creatures are as large as elephants with huge red eyes tremendous looped horns and long furry dinosaurlike tails The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON FLOOR The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon Luke with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder stands before little Artoo LUKE Hey whoa just where do you think youre going The little droid whistles a feeble reply as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner Well have no more of this ObiWan Kenobi jibberish and dont talk to me about your mission either Youre fortunate he doesnt blast you into a million pieces right here LUKE Well come on Its getting late I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up THREEPIO If you dont mind my saying so sir I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until youve gotten him back to your workshop LUKE No hes not going to try anything Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams LUKE Whats wrong with him now THREEPIO Oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south LUKE Sandpeople Or worst Come on lets have a look Come on EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON RIDGE DAY Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars He spots the two riderless Banthas Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I dont see any wait a second theyre Sandpeople all right I can see one of them now Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view Before Luke or Threepio can react a large gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them Threepio is startled and backs away right off the side if the cliff He can be heard for several moments as he clangs bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain The towering creature brings down his curved doublepointed gaderffii the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle which is smashed to pieces The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh EXT TATOOINE ROCK CANYON FLOOR DAY Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker who is dropped in a heap before the speeder The Sandpeople ransack the speeder throwing parts and supplies in all directions Suddenly they stop Then everything is quiet for a few moments A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer until a shabby old desertratofaman appears and leans over Luke His ancient leathery face cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him BEN Hello there Come here my little friend Dont be afraid Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern Ben puts his hand on Lukes forehead and he begins to come around BEN Dont worry hell be all right LUKE What happened BEN Rest easy son youve had a busy day Youre fortunate youre still in one piece LUKE Ben Ben Kenobi Boy am I glad to see you BEN The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly Tell me young Luke what brings you out this far LUKE Oh this little droid I think hes searching for his former master Ive never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems to be no stopping him He claims to be the property of an ObiWan Kenobi Is he a relative of yours Do you know who hes talking about Ben ponders this for a moment scratching his scruffy beard BEN ObiWan Kenobi ObiWan Now thats a name I havent heard in a long time a long time LUKE I think my uncle knew him He said he was dead BEN Oh hes not dead not not yet LUKE You know him BEN Well of course of course I know him Hes me I havent gone by the name ObiWan since oh before you were born LUKE Then the droid does belong to you BEN Dont seem to remember ever owning a droid Very interesting He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs BEN I think we better get indoors The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers Luke sits up and rubs his head Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something He looks around LUKE Threepio EXT TATOOINE SAND PIT ROCK MESA DAY Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand One of his arms has broken off Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical mans systems turn on THREEPIO Where am I I must have taken a bad step LUKE Can you stand Weve got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return THREEPIO I dont think I can make it You go on Master Luke Theres no sense in you risking yourself on my account Im done for Artoo makes a beeping sound LUKE No youre not What kind of talk is that Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit Ben glances around suspiciously Sensing something he stands up and sniffs the air BEN Quickly son theyre on the move INT KENOBIS DWELLING The small spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of timeworn comfort and security Luke is in one corner repairing Threepios arm as old Ben sits thinking LUKE No my father didnt fight in the wars He was a navigator on a spice freighter BEN Thats what your uncle told you He didnt hold with your fathers ideals Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars BEN Yes I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father LUKE I wish Id known him BEN He was the best starpilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior I understand youve become quite a good pilot yourself And he was a good friend Which reminds me Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on Threepio looks at him nervously Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it BEN I have something here for you Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldnt allow it He feared you might follow old ObiWan on some damnedfool idealistic crusade like your father did THREEPIO Sir if youll not be needing me Ill close down for awhile LUKE Sure go ahead Ben hands Luke the saber LUKE What is it BEN Your fathers lightsaber This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster Luke pushes a button on the handle A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there The light plays across the ceiling BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic Before the dark times before the Empire Luke hasnt really been listening LUKE How did my father die BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights He betrayed and murdered your father Now the Jedi are all but extinct Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force LUKE The Force BEN Well the Force is what gives a Jedi his power Its an energy field created by all living things It surrounds us and penetrates us It binds the galaxy together Artoo makes beeping sounds BEN Now lets see if we cant figure out what you are my little friend And where you come from LUKE I saw part of the message he was Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoos face BEN I seem to have found it Luke stops his work as the lovely girls image flickers before his eyes LEIA General Kenobi years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire I regret that I am unable to present my fathers request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and Im afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit My father will know how to retrieve it You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan This is our most desperate hour Help me ObiWan Kenobi youre my only hope There is a little static and the transmission is cut short Old Ben leans back and scratches his head He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe Luke has stars in his eyes BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if youre to come with me to Alderaan LUKE laughing Alderaan Im not going to Alderaan Ive got to go home Its late Im in for it as it is BEN I need your help Luke She needs your help Im getting too old for this sort of thing LUKE I cant get involved Ive got work to do Its not that I like the Empire I hate it But theres nothing I can do about it right now Its such a long way from here BEN Thats your uncle talking LUKE sighing Oh God my uncle How am I ever going to explain this BEN Learn about the Force Luke LUKE Look I can take you as far as Anchorhead You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever youre going BEN You must do what you feel is right of course EXT SPACE An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planetlike battle station the Death Star INT DEATH STAR CONFERENCE ROOM Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room Commander Tagge a young slimylooking general is speaking TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped Theyre more dangerous than you realize The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet Commander not to this battle station TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagges speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin governor of the Imperial outland regions enters He is followed by his powerful ally The Sith Lord Darth Vader All of the generals stand and bow before the thin evillooking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table The Dark Lord stands behind him TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us Ive just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away TAGGE Thats impossible How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories Fear will keep the local systems in line Fear of this battle station TAGGE And what of the Rebellion If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data theyve obtained This station is now the ultimate power in the universe I suggest we use it VADER Dont be too proud of this technological terror youve constructed The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force MOTTI Dont try to frighten us with your sorcerers ways Lord Vader Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels hidden fort Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vaders spell VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing TARKIN Enough of this Vader release him VADER As you wish TARKIN This bickering is pointless Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke EXT TATOOINE WASTELAND The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies LUKE It looks like Sandpeople did this all right Look here are Gaffi sticks Bantha tracks Its just I never heard of them hitting anything this big before Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks BEN They didnt But we are meant to think they did These tracks are side by side Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio BEN And these blast points too accurate for Sandpeople Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas and put two and two together LUKE If they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to And that would lead them home Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization then races for the speeder and jumps it BEN Wait Luke Its too dangerous Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler EXT TATOOINE WASTELAND Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder EXT TATOOINE LARS HOMESTEAD The speeder roars up to the burning homestead Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place LUKE Uncle Owen Aunt

Leias face is filled with defiance which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters followed by Darth Vader VADER And now Your Highness we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard EXT TATOOINE WASTELAND There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him BEN Theres nothing you could have done Luke had you been there Youd have been killed too and the droids

his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smokefilled cantina The murky moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic

scum A huge roughlooking Bartender stops Luke and the robots BARTENDER We dont serve their kind here Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures doesnt quite catch the bartenders drift LUKE What BARTENDER Your droids Theyll have to wait outside We dont want them here Luke looks at old Ben who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder LUKE Listen why dont you wait out by the speeder We dont want any trouble THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks Ben is standing next to Chewbacca an eightfoottall savage looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboonlike fangs His large blue eyes dominate a fur covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance Over his matted furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers and little else He is a twohundredyearold Wookiee and a sight to behold Ben speaks to the Wookiee pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee Luke is terrified but tries not to show it He quietly sips his drink looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever A large multipleeyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger The hideous freak is obviously drunk Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink A short grubby Human and an even smaller rodentlike beast join the belligerent monstrosity HUMAN He doesnt like you LUKE Im sorry HUMAN I dont like you either The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous young adventurer HUMAN Dont insult us You just watch yourself Were wanted men I have the death sentence in twelve systems LUKE Ill be careful than HUMAN Youll be dead The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away Luke tries to remain cool but it isnt easy His three adversaries ready their weapons Old Ben moves in behind Luke BEN This little one isnt worth the effort Come let me buy you something A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young wouldbe Jedi sailing across the room crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foullooking liquid With a blood curdling shriek the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben The bartender panics BARTENDER No blasters No blaster With astounding agility old Bens laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor The rodent is cut in two and the giant multipleeyed creature lies doubled cut from chin to groin Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt Luke shaking and totally amazed at the old mans abilities attempts to stand The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds The cantina goes back to normal although Ben is given

Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and thatd end your trip real quick wouldnt it The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash LUKE Whats that flashing HAN Were losing our deflector shield Go strap yourself in Im going to make the jump to light speed The galaxy brightens and they move faster

looms behind the Death Star battlestation INT DEATH STAR CONTROL ROOM Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet MOTTI Weve entered the Alderaan system Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia Her hands are bound LEIA Governor Tarkin I should have expected to find you holding Vaders leash I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board TARKIN Charming to the last You dont know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life LEIA I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself TARKIN Princess Leia before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now LEIA The more you tighten your grip Tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station In a way you have determined the choice of the planet thatll be destroyed first Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base I have chosen to test this stations destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan LEIA No Alderaan is peaceful We have no weapons You cant possibly TARKIN You would prefer another target A military target Then name the system Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia TARKIN I grow tired of asking this So itll be the last time Where is the Rebel base Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan LEIA softly Dantooine Leia lowers her head LEIA Theyre on Dantooine TARKIN There You see Lord Vader she can be reasonable addressing Motti Continue with the operation You may fire when ready LEIA What TARKIN Youre far too trusting Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration But dont worry We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough LEIA No INT DEATH STAR BLAST CHAMBER VADER Commence primary ignition A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever Another lever is pulled Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up A huge beam of light emanates from within a coneshaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust INT MILLENNIUM FALCON CENTRAL HOLD AREA Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small seeker robot Ben suddenly turns away and sits down He falters seems almost faint LUKE Are you all right Whats wrong BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced I fear something terrible has happened Ben rubs his forehead He seems to drift into a trance Then he fixes his gaze on Luke BEN Youd better get on with your exercises Han Solo enters the room HAN Well you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs I told you Id outrun em Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber HAN Dont everyone thank me at once Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which threedimensional holographic figures move along a chesstype board HAN Anyway we should be at Alderaan about ohtwohundred hours Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur covered arms over his head THREEPIO Now be careful Artoo Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square A sudden frown crosses Chewbaccas face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee THREEPIO He made a fair move Screaming about it wont help you HAN interrupting Let him have it Its not wise to upset a Wookiee THREEPIO But sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid HAN Thats cause droids dont pull peoples arms out of their socket when they lose Wookiees are known to do that THREEPIO I see your point sir I suggest a new strategy Artoo Let the Wookiee win Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area he seems frozen in place A humming lightsaber is held high over his head Ben watches him from the corner studying his movements Han watches with a bit of smugness BEN Remember a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him LUKE You mean it controls your actions BEN Partially But it also obeys your commands Suspended at eye level about ten feet in front of Luke a seeker a chrome baseballlike robot covered with antennae hovers slowly in a wide arc The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other Suddenly it makes a lightningswift lunge and stops within a few feet of Lukes face Luke doesnt move and the ball backs off It slowly moves behind the boy then makes another quick lunge this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over Han lets loose with a burst of laughter HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid LUKE You dont believe in the Force do you HAN Kid Ive flown from one side of this galaxy to the other Ive seen a lot of strange stuff but Ive never seen anything to make me believe theres one allpowerful force controlling everything Theres no mystical energy field that controls my destiny Ben smiles quietly HAN Its all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense BEN I suggest you try it again Luke Ben places a large helmet on Lukes head which covers his eyes BEN This time let go your conscious self and act on instinct LUKE laughing With the blast shield down I cant even see How am I supposed to fight BEN Your eyes can deceive you Dont trust them Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air The ball shoots straight up in the air then drops like a rock Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker BEN Stretch out with your feelings Luke stands in one place seemingly frozen The seeker makes a dive at Luke and incredibly he managed to deflect the bolt The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position BEN You see you can do it HAN I call it luck BEN In my experience theres no such thing as luck HAN Look going good against remotes is one thing Going good against the living Thats something else Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel HAN Looks like were coming up on Alderaan Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit LUKE You know I did feel something I could almost see the remote BEN Thats good You have taken your first step into a larger world INT DEATH STAR CONFERENCE ROOM Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader TARKIN Yes OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine They found the remains of a Rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems TARKIN She lied She lied to us VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion TARKIN Terminate her immediately EXT HYPERSPACE The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship INT MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT HAN Stand by Chewie here we go Cut in the sublight engines Han pulls back on a control lever Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past seem to decrease in speed then stop Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about Asteroids begin to race toward them battering the sides of the ship HAN What the Aw weve come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower Some kind of asteroid collision Its not on any of the charts The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit LUKE Whats going on HAN Our position is correct except no Alderaan LUKE What do you mean Where is it HAN Thats what Im trying to tell you kid It aint there Its been totally blown away LUKE What How Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down BEN Destroyed by the Empire HAN The entire starfleet couldnt destroy the whole planet Itd take a thousand ships with more fire power than Ive A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming HAN Theres another ship coming in LUKE Maybe they know what happened BEN Its an Imperial fighter Chewbacca barks his concern A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window shaking the ship violently A tiny finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window LUKE It followed us BEN No Its a short range fighter HAN There arent any bases around here Where did it come from EXT SPACE The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship INT MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry If they identify us were in big trouble HAN Not if I can help it Chewiejam its transmissions BEN Itd be as well to let it go Its too far out of range HAN Not for long EXT SPACE The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter INT MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter In the distance one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it Ben stands behind Chewbacca BEN A fighter that size couldnt get this deep into space on its own LUKE It must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something HAN Well he aint going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us EXT SPACE The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head INT MILLENNIUM FALCON COCKPIT The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet LUKE Look at him Hes headed for that small moon HAN I think I can get him before he gets there hes almost in range The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station BEN Thats no moon Its a space station HAN Its too big to be a space station LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this HAN Yeah I think your right Full reverse Chewie lock in the auxiliary power The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station LUKE Why are we still moving towards it HAN Were caught in a tractor beam Its pulling us in LUKE But theres gotta be something you can do HAN Theres nothin I can do about it kid Im in full power Im going to have to shut down But theyre not going to get me without a fight Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder BEN You cant win But there are alternatives to fighting INT MILLENNIUM FALCON DEATH STAR As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a milehigh band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged EXT DEATH STAR HUGE PORT DOORS The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port

this ship checked INT MILLENNIUM FALCON HALLWAY A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit In a few moments all is quiet The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker LUKE Boy its lucky you had these compartments HAN I use them for smuggling I never thought Id be smuggling myself in them This is ridiculous Even if I could take off Id never get past the tractor beam BEN Leave that to me HAN Damn fool I knew that you were going to say that BEN Whos the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him Han shakes his head muttering to himself Chewbacca agrees INT DEATH STAR MAIN FORWARD BAY The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp TROOPER The ships all yours If the scanners pick up anything report it immediately All right lets go The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below HANS VOICE Hey down there could you give us a hand with this The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard INT DEATH STAR FORWARD BAY COMMAND OFFICE In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing He speaks into the comlink GANTRY OFFICER TXfouronetwo Why arent you at your post TXfouronetwo do you copy A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door giving his aide an annoyed look GANTRY OFFICER Take over Weve got a bad transmitter Ill see what I can do As the officer approaches the door it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca The gantry officer in a momentary state of shock stumbles backward With a bone chilling howl the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow The aide immediately reaches for his pistol but is blasted by Han dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke also dressed as a stormtrooper Luke quickly removes his helmet LUKE You know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight its a wonder the whole station doesnt know were here HAN Bring them on I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around THREEPIO We found the computer outlet sir Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor He begins to inspect it carefully Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly BEN Plug in He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life feeding information to the little robot After a few moments he beeps something THREEPIO He says hes found the main computer to power the tractor beam thats holding the ship here Hell try to make the precise location appear on the monitor The computer monitor flashes readouts THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave Ben studies the data on the monitor readout BEN I dont think you boys can help I must go alone HAN Whatever you say Ive done more that I bargained for on this trip already LUKE I want to go with you BEN Be patient Luke Stay and watch over the droids LUKE But he can BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan Your destiny lies along a different path than mine The Force will be with you always Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office then disappears down a long grey hallway Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement HAN Boy you said it Chewie Han looks at Luke HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil LUKE Ben is a great man HAN Yeah great at getting us into trouble LUKE I didnt hear you give any ideas HAN Well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up LUKE Who do you think Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak Luke goes over to him LUKE What is it THREEPIO Im afraid Im not quite sure sir He says I found her and keeps repeating Shes here LUKE Well who who has he found Artoo whistles a frantic reply THREEPIO Princess Leia LUKE The princess Shes here HAN Princess Whats going on THREEPIO Level five Detention block A Atwenty three Im afraid shes scheduled to be terminated LUKE Oh no Weve got to do something HAN What are you talking about LUKE The droid belongs to her Shes the one in

block HAN Im not going anywhere LUKE Theyre going to execute her Look a few minutes ago you said you didnt want to just wait here to be captured Now all you want to do is stay HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind LUKE But theyre going to kill her HAN Better her than me LUKE Shes rich Chewbacca growls HAN Rich LUKE Yes Rich powerful Listen if you were to rescue her the reward would be HAN What LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine HAN I dont know I can imagine quite a bit LUKE Youll get it HAN I better LUKE You will HAN All right kid But youd better be right about this Han looks at Chewie who grunts a short grunt LUKE All right HAN Whats your plan LUKE Uh Threepio hand me those binders there will you Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs LUKE Okay Now Im going to put these on you Chewie lets out a hideous growl LUKE Okay Han you put these on Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han HAN Dont worry Chewie I think I know what he has in mind The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs THREEPIO Master Luke sir Pardon me for asking but ah what should Artoo and I do if were discovered here LUKE Lock the door HAN And hope they dont have blasters THREEPIO That isnt very reassuring Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star INT DEATH STAR DETENTION AREA ELEVATOR TUBE Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive Troops bureaucrats and robots bustle about ignoring the trio completely Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters LUKE I cant see a thing in this helmet A bureaucrat races to get aboard also but is signaled away by Han The door to the podlike vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube INT DEATH STAR MAIN HALLWAY Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face At the far end of the hallway a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears then disappears down a small hallway His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion No one in the hallway seems to notice him INT DEATH STAR INTERIOR ELEVATOR DETENTION SECURITY AREA Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator but the door slides open behind them The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station Guards and laser gates are everywhere Han whispers to Luke under his breath HAN This is not going to work LUKE Why didnt you say so before HAN I did say so before INT DETENTION AREA Elevator doors open A tall grim looking Officer approaches the trio OFFICER Where are you taking this thing Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block oneone threeeight OFFICER I wasnt notified Ill have to clear it The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information There are only three other troopers in the area Luke and Han survey the situation checking all of the alarms laser gates and camera eyes Han unfastens one of Chewbaccas electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his earpiercing howls He grabs Hans laser rifle HAN Look out Hes loose LUKE Hes going to pull us all apart HAN Go get him The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca but hits the camera eyes laser gate controls and the Imperial guards The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system Han rushes to the comlink system which is screeching questions about what is going on He quickly checks the computer readout HAN Weve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in Here it is cell twentyoneeightseven You go get her Ill hold them here Luke races down one of the cell corridors Han speaks into the buzzing comlink HAN sounding official Everything is under control Situation normal INTERCOM VOICE What happened HAN getting nervous Uh had a slight weapons malfunction But uh everythings perfectly all right now Were fine Were all fine here now thank you How are you INTERCOM VOICE Were sending a squad up HAN Uh uh negative We had a reactor leak here now Give us a few

be dead by now VADER Dont underestimate the power of the Force TARKIN The Jedi are extinct their fire has gone out of the universe You my friend are all thats left of their religion There is a quiet

other side of the elevator door HAN Chewie Chewbacca responds with a growling noise HAN Get behind me Get behind me A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame They turn and run down the cell hallway meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them HAN Cant get out that way LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route HAN sarcastically Maybe youd like it back in your cell Your Highness Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt

begins banging on the door TROOPER VOICE Open up in there THREEPIO Oh no INT DEATH STAR DETENTION CORRIDOR Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway The laserfire is very intense and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor LUKE There isnt any other way out HAN I cant hold them off forever Now what LEIA This is some rescue When you came in here didnt you have a plan for getting out HAN pointing to Luke Hes the brains sweetheart Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders LUKE Well I didnt The princess grabs Lukes gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han almost frying him HAN What the hell are you doing LEIA Somebody has to save our skins Into the garbage chute wise guy She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something HAN Get in there you big furry oaf I dont care what you smell Get in there and dont worry about it Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening HAN Wonderful girl Either Im going to kill her or Im beginning to like her Get in there Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover then slides into the chute himself and is gone INT DEATH STAR GARBAGE ROOM Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open It wont budge HAN sarcastically Oh The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea What an incredible smell youve discovered Lets get out of here Get away from there LUKE No wait Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face LUKE Will you forget it I already tried it Its magnetically sealed LEIA Put that thing away Youre going to get us all killed HAN Absolutely Your Worship Look I had everything under control until you led us down here You know its not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us LEIA It could be worse A loud horrible inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls HAN Its worse LUKE Theres something alive in here HAN Thats your imagination LUKE Something just moves past my leg Look Did you see that HAN What LUKE Help Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage HAN Luke Luke Luke Solo tries to get to Luke Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs A membrane tentacle is

Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle HAN Luke Luke Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches Then everything is deathly quiet Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface LEIA Grab him Luke seems to be released by the thing LEIA What happened LUKE I dont know it just let go of me and disappeared HAN Ive got a very bad feeling about this Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels LUKE The walls are moving LEIA Dont just stand there Try to brace it with something They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher

adjustments in the computer terminal and several lights on the board go from red to blue INT DEATH STAR UNUSED HALLWAY The group exits the garbage room into a dusty unused hallway Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice we ought to be able to get out of here Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from

fire at him INT DEATH STAR SUBHALLWAY Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a lastditch attempt to save his bold captain Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling Around the corner shoots

wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway chased by several stormtroopers They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway INT DEATH STAR CENTRAL CORE SHAFT Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge deep shaft that seems to go into infinity The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft and Luke almost rushes into the abyss He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia behind him takes hold of his arm and pulls him back LUKE gasping I think we took a wrong turn Blasts from the stormtroopers laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger Luke fires back at the advancing troops Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door LEIA Theres no lock Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol LUKE That oughta hold it for a while LEIA Quick weve got to get across Find the control that extends the bridge LUKE Oh I think I just blasted it Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds LEIA Theyre coming through Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt when laserfire hits the wall behind him Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them They exchange fire Two more troops appear on another overhang also firing A trooper is hit and grabs at his chest Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Lukes laserfire and plummets down the shaft Troopers move back off the bridge Luke hands the gun to Leia LUKE Here hold this Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt It has a grappler hook on it A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia As Luke works with the rope Leia returns the laser volley Another trooper appears and fires at them as Leia returns his fire as well Suddenly the hatch door begins to open revealing the feet of more troops LEIA Here they come Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above and he falls into the abyss Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure then grabs the princess in his arms Leia looks at Luke then kisses him quickly on the lips Luke is very surprised LEIA For luck Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway INT DEATH STAR NARROW PASSAGEWAY Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway He checks to make

warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi Another of the Jedis blows is blocked then countered Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in midair creating a low buzzing sound VADER Your powers

shoulder at Luke lifts his sword from Vaders then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face Vader brings his sword down cutting old Ben in half Bens cloak falls to the floor in two parts but Ben is not in it Vader is puzzled at Bens disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak As the guards are distracted the adventurers and the robots reach the starship Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him Aghast he yells out LUKE No The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon while Luke transfixed by anger and
